## Debian 6 VPS Script

Remove excess packages and install the basic components needed for a light-weight HTTP(S) web server.

dropbear (SSH)
iptables (firewall)
dash (replaces bash)
syslogd
MySQL
PHP 5.3+ CLI/CGI (running as PHP-fastcgi)
nginx (+1.0 from dotdeb)
exim4
wordpress

Includes sample nginx config files for PHP sites.

Running the following will create an nginx config (/etc/nginx/site-enabled/example.com.conf), site directory (/var/www/example.com), log file (/var/www/log/example.com/), and a MySQL database.

./setup-debian.sh domain example.com

When running the iptables install you must specify a SSH port to allow (22 is the default). Future support will allow xinetd.d to use an alternate port for SSH. However, for now port 22 is all that works with this script and xinetd.d.
